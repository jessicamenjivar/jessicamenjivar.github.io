           <p>  my program is write in p5.js in  popcode.org a website where you can code and use javascript to create different type of actions.the purpose of my program is that ball green and red to bounce back from a negative position and also from a positive position and at some point meet up with one another.in this video clip,you can see how theirs a square with 4 lines that go in a different direction ,we can see 4 ball  each of them have a color purple,black,red,green.
                
                </p>  
                <p>
                  we can see how that black ball it stay in that same position in that midu and how that purple ball in that same direction but in that y-axis line on that positive direction.
                there's a ball that is green ball moving up from that y-axis in that negative direction and there's a ball in that x-axis that moves from a positive direction to that negative direction and it bounces back each time to that positive and also at some point is going to intercept with that green ball in that medium where that black ball is and they will meet to one another and  cross to that other side .
